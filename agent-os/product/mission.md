# Mission

## Problem

Blank page paralysis — journaling feels like a chore. Prompts elsewhere feel stale.

## Target Users

- Experienced journalers needing fresh inspiration
- Beginners who don't know where to start

## Solution

Slot machine mechanic: playful, gamified randomness of pulling a lever to get a journal prompt. Transforms the blank page into a moment of surprise and delight.
